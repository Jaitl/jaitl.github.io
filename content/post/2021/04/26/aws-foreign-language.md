AWS provides several Artificial Intelligence (AI) services. With AI services, you could implement some useful AI things: image and video analysis, document analysis, text to speech or speech to text translation, and so on. However, those AWS services can be used not only for enterprise applications but for your self-development applications.

We are interested in three AI services now:
* Polly — text to speech service. It generates audio by text.
* Transcribe — speech to text service. It recognizes speech to text.
* Translate — translate service. It translates a text from one language to another one.
